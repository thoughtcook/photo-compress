- **Multi-Format Support**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, and AVIF compression
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images simultaneously
- **Quality Control**: Adjustable compression quality (10% - 100%)
- **Smart Resizing**: Proportional scaling with max width/height limits
- **Real-time Preview**: See before/after comparisons instantly
- **Performance Optimized**: Web Workers prevent UI blocking on large images
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Automatic theme switching based on system preference
- **Export Options**: Download individual images or batch ZIP export

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct File Access
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser. No server required!

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npm install
npm run serve-node

# Using live-server for development
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Option 3: StackBlitz
You can also run this project directly in StackBlitz by uploading the files or importing from a repository.

## üéØ Usage

1. **Upload Images**: Drag & drop images or click to select files
2. **Adjust Settings**:
   - Quality: 10% - 100% (lower = smaller file, less quality)
   - Max Width/Height: Resize images proportionally
   - Output Format: Choose JPEG, PNG, WebP, or AVIF
3. **Compress**: Click "Compress Images" to process all images
4. **Download**: Get individual images or download all as ZIP

- **Web Workers**: Prevents UI blocking during compression
- **Canvas API**: High-quality image processing
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features for clean, efficient code

### Browser Support
- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

### Key Dependencies
- **JSZip**: For creating ZIP archives (loaded via CDN)
- **Canvas API**: For image processing
- **Web Workers**: For background processing
- **File API**: For handling file uploads

## üé® Customization

The tool automatically adapts to your system's dark/light theme preference. All styling is contained within the HTML file using CSS custom properties for easy customization.

## üì± Mobile Support

The interface is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices. Touch-friendly controls and optimized layouts ensure a smooth experience on tablets and phones.

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **100% Local Processing**: No data is ever sent to external servers
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, cookies, or tracking scripts
- **EXIF Removal**: Automatically strips metadata from images
- **Secure**: Runs entirely in your browser's secure context

## ‚ö° Performance

- **Web Workers**: Large image processing doesn't block the UI
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of object URLs
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Smart resizing and compression techniques
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during processing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Large Images
- Files over 50MB are automatically rejected
- Use Web Workers to handle processing without UI freeze
- Memory usage is optimized with proper cleanup

### Browser Compatibility
- Ensure your browser supports modern features (Canvas, Web Workers, File API)
- Use HTTPS if serving from a web server
- Some older browsers may not support AVIF format

### Performance Issues
- Reduce max dimensions for faster processing
- Lower quality settings for smaller files
- Process fewer images simultaneously if experiencing slowdowns
